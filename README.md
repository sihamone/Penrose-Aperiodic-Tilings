# Penrose-Aperiodic-Tilings
In include here the Penrose Aperiodic Tilings (Rhomb and Dart &amp; Kite representations) generated by an integer algorithm. 
It is a simplified code which shows how to create aperiodic tilings with an integer represenation using a 10th cyclotomic division of the plane. It was generated with the purpose of creating aperiodic tilings much easier, to manipulate the structure of the tilings more easily and play with the tiles in each iteration. 

Aperiodic tilings are patterns that cover a plane without ever repeating.
Penrose tilings, a notable example of aperiodic tilings, use two prototiles,
often referred to as kites and darts or rhombs, arranged according to sub-
stitution rules to avoid periodic repetition. The substitution method allows
us to generate Penrose tilings through an integer based representation of
tiles. This approach addresses the complications arising when dealing with
floating point precision issues by manipulating the integer lattices of the
tiles, enabling their inflation, rotation and shifting according to substitution
rules to generate the tilings.
