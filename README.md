# Penrose-Aperiodic-Tilings
Penrose Aperiodic Tiling (Rhomb and Dart &amp; Kite representation)
I include here the final coding algorithm used in order to create aperiodic tilings with an integer represenation. It was generated with the purpose of creating aperiodic tilings much easier, to manipulate the structure of the tilings more easily and play with the tiles in each iteration.
